# LastHoranBot

I built this bot for The Last Horan LAN party on 5/18/2018.  Out of curiosity, because I had never built a Discord bot, I decided to build this on a whim.  As I started to have fun with it, I thought it would be awesome to include an easter egg for my students (freshly primed from Ready Player One) to find.  

That easter egg was a text-based adventure game, the main program for that being in peddlers_dungeon.py.

Feel free to use this code for your own purposes.
